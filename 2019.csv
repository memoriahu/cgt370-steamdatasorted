The real deal starts the morning after, and this is the exact time when you, dear player enter the cruel world of Out of Reach . Although the archipelago was considered deserted before ships started to crash into sea rocks nearby, every kind of area on the island has its natural inhabitants who just don't give a warm welcome. Thinking twice every time before moving ahead could be one of the smartest things to do. Staying on a beach after crushing your boat allows you to hunt for slowly moving animals and gives the ability to see at long distances. Disadvantage - you can be seen from exactly the same distance and there's always someone to call you his own slow-moving food. In order to stay on the top of the food chain, you need to work harder than others. Everything starts from finding certain resources. Chop trees, mine stone, gather flax and food. Equip yourself and start searching for more sophisticated materials like copper and tin to produce bronze and other alloys. Use a variety of workshops, furnaces and tools to craft armour and weapons. Check which combination of gear has better performance and suits your game style best. Upgrade equipment using new resources or items obtained in battle. Store, collect or trade your stuff with other players! Looking for a place to store your timber or a quiet and cosy room to forge a sword and tan a skin of an elephant? Build your own stronghold! Use dozens of building elements like walls, stairs and floors to assemble the house of your dreams in an environment of your choice... or just take control of one. The best solutions to problems are most often invented during battles. Everyday life on islands full of castaways is not an exception. To successfully protect your territory or gain control of a new one, you will need the advantage. Ballista The greater the distance, the safer you are. Ballista may be slow to load and unable to move but the ability to pierce a target with a 1,5m dart few hundred meters away in no time shouldn't be underestimated. Trebuchet Unusual situations require extraordinary solutions. When an axe doesn't help or doors are just too thick it's time for a trebuchet. Construction costs both time and resources but nothing surprises like a forced entry through a wall. Traps Well, there's actually one thing that surprises more - a tricky and deadly trap! Use trip wires at the doors, stairs or wherever you want, connect them with ballistae or boulder throwers, place a bait and wait for the unwelcome guests. Glider When everything fails, you might consider an attack from above. Construct a tower, install a launcher ramp and take off on a glider to bomb enemies' bases, get through walls or just take a look from a different perspective.

Advanced Features Even though Simple VR Video Player was designed to be easy and simple to use application for normal users, under the hood, there is a tremendous amount of advanced features you can explore and experiment with, especially for power users with high-end computers. Super Sampling Resolution Super sampling is a brute force rendering technique that greatly improves image quality in virtual reality headsets. It works by rendering the 3D scene an X percentage higher than the physical resolution of the display and then resizing/downsampling the image back to your display. This results in an expensive form of high quality anti-aliasing that delivers a cleaner looking rendered image.  You can fine tune super sampling settings in real-time. Introducing Super Enhanced Mode Simple VR Video Player is excited to introduce Super Enhanced Mode! Sharpen your video and drastically improve image fidelity by enabling ""Super Enhance"" in the options. The Super Enhance technique utilizes an intelligent sharpening algorithm to enhance contrast and details while maintaining image quality.  This feature when combined with high Super Sampling effectively upscales, sharpens, and downscales the video for greatly improved clarity especially on virtual reality headsets. Multiple Video Decoding Options Supports Microsoft Media Foundation, DirectShow, LibVLC, and PopMovie for multiple video decoding solutions. What Can It Play? Simple VR Video Player was built to take advantage of multiple video decoding engines in the backend to offer the greatest compatibility.  As a general rule of thumb, if your Windows Media Player can play the movie, so can Simple VR Video Player. Media Foundation (Win 8/10) is a super optimized DX11 hardware accelerated decoder built into the latest versions of Windows with full h264 decoding support. For more advanced users, you can change the video decoding engine to use another video backend such as DirectShow which allows you to use DirectShow decoders, filters, and splitters such as LAV and ffdshow.  Just choose the best decoding option for you! * Note: The player can't play Blu-ray discs since they are DRM'd and encrypted! It's Simple! We wanted to create the first simple and easy to use VR video player to take advantage of the Vive and it's hand motion controls.

It is a game of deceit, accusations and unpredictability. It challenges the player's ability to lie and detect other players that are lying. HOW TO PLAY Players are assigned a random role to be either Agents or Hackers. In order to win the game with your team you must capture three nodes. In each round, there are three phases. The Talking Phase, The Voting Phase and the Mission Phase.After a team proposal for a mission node, each player on the proposed and voted team must secretly perform an action on the mission node. Agents may only secure the node. Hackers may either secure or hack based on their preference. Hackers have the objective to hack three nodes while Agents need to secure three nodes from the total of five. As a hacker you know who your fellow hackers are, but as an agent, you know only who you are. Take a look at the How To Play Video to better understand the rules and gameplay. https://youtu.be/MoSxtK-pPnQ ?€??€? Secure. Seek. Subvert. ???????? Be an agent attempting to secure the city network, or be a hacker attempting to compromise and defeat them. Utilize your communication, manipulation, and deduction skills to persuade others and win the game.  You?€?ll never play the same game twice.

Hackers have been searching for a way to break into them for years. Save or corrupt the network by working together. Remember...in the future, anyone could be compromised. Who can you trust? ?? The game is a tribute to social party games such as The Resistance and Werewolf.

Story : You?€?re a newly employed guard of a prison deep inside a dungeon. The night of your arrival, strange things happen and when you wake up in the morning, all prisoners have escaped amidst chaos. The warden wisely decides to leave the dungeon as quickly as possible, while tasking you to run after the escaping prisoners. You then assemble your team and venture into the mysterious dungeon. A Call For Adventure : Enter a big, massive dungeon, full of danger, mystery and secrets. Fight your way through hordes of enemies and powerful creatures. Explore intricate corridors, underground palaces, mines fallen into oblivion and evil crypts. Solve puzzles, avoid deadly traps, uncover hidden passages, and keep your bearing through mazes & hallways. Character Building : You?€?ll take command of a party of 4 guardians. Each guardian comes with a set of spells & abilities, with new ones appearing over the course of the adventure. For each new level reached, the guardians get a point to use in their talent trees, allowing them to reinforce their abilities or gain new powers. There are 4 classes to choose from: the warrior, the healer, the mage & the rogue. Each class has 3 specializations represented by a talent tree, and each specialization comes with its own set of abilities. So you have 12 base build-ups. In addition, your guardians can choose freely to spend their talent points in any of the 3 specializations of their class, allowing for even more varied set-ups. The dungeon is filled with loot: epic armors, legendary weapons and mystical, magical items. Often when you kill a group of enemies, they?€?ll drop a random piece of equipment that one of your guardians can use, raising more and more of their powers. Evolved Combat System : The combat is focused on the triptych ?€?tank/damage dealer/healer?€? mechanism, coupled with an exciting threat mechanism: your healer?€?s spells directly threaten all the enemies nearby, and thus your tank must use his abilities to attract their wrath and protect the healer. The tank must then be able to mitigate a lot of the enemy damage using his defensive skills. Your last 2 guardians will be the damage dealers, trying to kill the enemies as fast as possible, while they?€?re busy with the tank. All guardians get a lot of abilities and not only will using the right one at the right moment be essential to your party?€?s survival, but also combining different abilities in sequence to maximize their efficiency will be required to vanquish your strongest foes. It sounds like a lot, but fortunately the game comes with an active pause: you can pause the game whenever you feel like it, check everything, queue the next abilities for your guardians, and then resume the game. You don?€?t like tanks, or you don?€?t like pausing the game? No problem, just lower the game difficulty, and you?€?ll be able to play without a real tank or pausing. You can precisely tune the difficulty at any time during your exploration. Unlike old-school FPV Dungeon Crawlers, you don?€?t have to strafe-turn-strafe-turn all the time in Dungeon Guardians. Your tank comes with serious defensive skills (armor, dodge & parry) that let him handle most of the enemy attacks, as long as the healer backs him up. So most fights are done while standing your ground. However, occasionally your whole party will have to dodge some extremely powerful enemy attacks, usually by walking back, so you?€?ll still need some moving reflexes and awareness of your surroundings during the fights. Built-in Map editor & Modding : The game comes with a full featured map editor, letting you create your own dungeons. The basics are very simple, but a bit of learning will be required to handle the more advanced puzzle mechanisms. Additionally, with the Modding SDK, you?€?ll be able to fine-tune the existing enemies, classes, specializations, abilities, talents, gear, and enchantments, and with a bit of dedication you should be able to add your own, and even add sound FX or music.

If you have not played it, then I beg thee delve farther into these depths at your own risk, dear player! An anthology series that serves as a Corpse Party sequel, prequel, midquel, and alternate universe tale all in one, Corpse Party: Book of Shadows is a horror/adventure game developed by MAGES. (formerly 5pb. Games) and published under the supervision of the original series creators at Team GrisGris. Corpse Party: Book of Shadows builds upon the events of the first game, exploring or re-exploring past incidents, characters, and points of view, and allowing the player to escape many of the deaths that occurred previously, thus steering them toward all-new (albeit not necessarily better) outcomes. This PC version updates the original PSP system version?€?s art to HD and adds full mouse support for authentic point-and-click gameplay, providing the definitive Corpse Party: Book of Shadows experience for series fans who are eager to delve a little deeper into its storied lore. Before, during, and after the events of Corpse Party ?€?in the canon universe, as well as in several alternate timelines?€?the students of Kisaragi Academy, Byakudan Senior High, Paulownia High, and Musashigawa Middle School had far more experiences within the cursed halls of Heavenly Host Elementary than the stories typically recount. How would events have unfolded, for example, in a universe where each student went into the Sachiko Ever After ritual with an unconscious awareness of everything that was going to happen to them? What might?€?ve occurred to Mayu if she?€?d never interacted with the ghostly children in the school infirmary? What might?€?ve occurred to Yuka if she?€?d been caught during the harrowing chase in the second wing? What might?€?ve occurred to Seiko if Naomi had gotten to the bathroom just a bit earlier? On the other side of the coin, how did Naho actually get into Heavenly Host, and whom did she come with? What was Tohko?€?s relationship with Kizami, and how did that result in a lost tooth? And what connection did Ms. Yui have to the cursed elementary school prior to ever taking part in the Sachiko Ever After ritual? Most crucially, what happened to the survivors of the previous incident after their escape? How did the loss of their friends affect them? And what does all of this have to do with the mysterious tome known as the ?€?Book of Shadows?€??€?? FEATURES Point-and-Click-Style First-Person Gameplay More realistically proportioned and immersive first-person environments bring Heavenly Host to life in all its grim glory, with point-and-click-style ?€?Search Mode?€? allowing players to scour every inch of every room via keyboard, gamepad, mouse, or any combination thereof?€? Original Japanese Voiceovers with More 3D Audio Than Ever Before Every line of dialogue is spoken in its original Japanese by a who?€?s who of Japanese voiceover talent, with many crucial scenes recorded in binaural 3D using dummy-head microphones: play with quality headphones or a hi-fi stereo setup to hear the horror coming from all around you, or perhaps from right next to your ear?€? Dastardly ?€?Darkening?€? System Leads to Painful Demise Characters gradually become frightened and unstable as horrific discoveries are made, distorting the game?€?s graphics and altering their decision-making abilities; continuing down these darkened paths will result in one of the game?€?s many dozens of gruesome ?€?Wrong Ends,?€? all of which are virtually guaranteed to replay in players?€? nightmares?€? Enhanced Focus on Side Characters The already robust cast from the original game is further humanized, with a focus on those characters whose screen time may have been lacking before; learn more about your favorite side characters, and find out just what was going on in their heads (before those heads were crushed)?€? Unlockables, Achievements, and More Steam achievements, collectibles, voice cast interviews, music tracks, art stills, and more are unlockable through a variety of means for attentive and detail-oriented players; additionally, those who?€?ve conquered or even just dabbled in the first Corpse Party will be able to import their save-data to unlock dozens more art stills, and possibly even make the crucial final chapter of the story available to play through a bit sooner than it otherwise would be?€? "," Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  This title is a horror visual novel with point-and-click interaction. Contains excessive violence and gore depicted via full-screen art stills, textual descriptions, and Japanese-language voice-acting, specifically including the mutilation, torture, and murder of children. Also contains images of female anime-style characters with exposed underwear or cleavage, shown in restraints, or in one instance shown bathing together with strategically placed steam to cover up private areas.

The old empire was destroyed and the civilizations in each world have suffered different fates, some of them have continued contact and others have lost it. These worlds have been separated for such a long time that many of them would not recognize each other. The legend says that two forces, one negative, one positive, are trying to recover the old empire and all of its crowns again. But we know very little about these forces or if they really exist. Other people are simply trying to understand what happened and the real nature of each world. Meanwhile each world continues with it?€?s own way and history. Recently, strange things have been happening?€? News is received from many places that problems are appearing; the normally peaceful villages are now at war, odd monsters appear in valleys where there was once placid ecology... Nobody knows why?€? The chain of communication between the worlds remains partially abandoned, partially destroyed and so unstable that to use it is a sure way to cause even more problems and dangers. A long time ago the Great Wall in Heliopolis was built to protect the civilians. Many people have used the portals but disappeared without trace.

Craft, equip, explore, and fight to stay alive as you delve deeper and face ever-greater threats in the twisting halls and endless chasms of the NECROPOLIS. Have no doubt, you?€?re going to die - often! - but you?€?ll improve your combat skills, available upgrades, and dungeon know-how with every playthrough, bringing you one step closer to the exit. (Warning: ?€?Just one more time?€? mindset can be addicting.) IN NECROPOLIS, DEATH IS... ...PERMANENT. Game Over? Jump right back in with a new adventurer and try again! ...DIFFERENT EVERY TIME. A new procedurally-generated dungeon with every death. ...BETTER WITH FRIENDS. Drop-in / drop-out CO-OP multiplayer for up to 4 players! ...MONSTROUS. Gemeaters, Changelings, Hoardmen, and more - they exist to kill you. ...NOT WITHOUT PERKS. Each new dungeon is littered with powerful weapons, armor, and upgrades to wield against your foes.

Gather as much treasure as you can before the nasty monsters get you. Explore about 50 different lands, each with its own unique treasures, enemies, and terrain obstacles. Your quest is to find the legendary treasure, the Orbs of Yendor. Collect one of them to win! Or just ignore your quest and collect smaller treasures. The twist is the unique, unusual geometry of the world: it is one of just few games which takes place on the hyperbolic plane . Witness a grid composed of hexagons and heptagons, straight lines which seem to be parallel, but then they diverge and never cross, triangles whose angles add up to less than 180 degrees, how extremely unlikely is it to reach the same place twice due to practically infinite size of the world (centillions of locations in just 700 steps from the starting point), and how the world seems to be rotated when you do return. All this matters for the gameplay. The game is inspired by the roguelike genre (although in a very minimalist way), works of M. C. Escher, and by puzzle games such as Deadly Rooms of Death. HyperRogue can be played for free from its website . The Steam version adds online achievements, online leaderboards , trading cards, and convenience.

									",English,26,"Indie,Strategy"," About This Game Cardlings is a novel tactical game, with new mechanics that result in fast paced games with no waiting time between turns. Your goal is to either destroy the enemy castle with any means at your disposal (and there are lots), or fully upgrade your own castle by gathering enough resources. But this is not a traditional turn-based game. While you play a combat turn, moving your units around and attacking, your opponent plays a building turn: they can place buildings and collect resources. At the end of each turn you switch roles. Only the player playing a combat turn can decide to end the turn, and it's in their best interest to do so as quickly as possible (to stop their opponent gathering lots of resources). This results in very intense, fast-paced games that still preserve all the depth of more traditional turn-based strategy titles. Ultimately it's a game of wits where the winner is the player who makes the best use of the cards in their hand and the resources in the procedurally generated maps. You will have to think quickly. Will you be able to defeat the AI on the hardest difficulty level? Will you be brave enough to challenge other human players online?

A fantasy sandbox, there is no ""do this to finish the game."" Explore, unlock recipes, seek out rare resources, build towns, level up, and own the wild.

Resources in Solace Crafting are tier and rarity based, meaning the more dangerous the area you're in the higher tier of resources will be available. In order to help you find elite and legendary grade resources you can build towns and populate them with NPCs to locate rare resources for you. Crafting Recipes in Solace Crafting are not predefined. A leather boots recipe creates leather boots, but the level, tier, rarity, and color are completely up to you, limited only by your resources and skills. As you push further and find increasingly powerful materials, upgrading your equipment is paramount to survival. Enchanting As with item crafting, enchanting recipes are customizable and can make a huge difference in your combat prowess and harvesting abilities. Exploration Unlock new recipes and seek out rare materials high in the mountains and deep underground. Or go looking for the perfect island to support your main base. Solace Crafting has no boundaries, no off limit areas. Adventuring Choose skills from four archetypes freely, mixing and matching your skills as you see fit. Most skills have no maximum level and can continue to level up with you as far as you're able to travel.

In-game guidance will show you how to use the keyboard to build huge structures without hardly needing to move.

Here are some of the design decisions I refined over the years that I do my best to uphold: No pay-to-win, no pay-to-play, no paid DLC, no gacha or gamble mechanics No metered progression Level any and all professions freely Minimal sub-ingredients, minimal crafting and refining timers Completely open, point and level based branching skill trees Multiple, incremental skill points every level Classic roles, not forced balance. Some classes may be harder than others Unlimited player levels Completely open physics-based world, no off-limits No ""realistic"" building physics that destroy everything when things go wrong Unlimited access to parallel realities (alternate seeds) Shape and color your avatars freely instead of using preset races Allow alternate characters in the same world Background My name is Kyle Postlewait (35) and I got into game development because I can't find the game that I want to play. I am not a veteran game developer. I do not have any published AAA titles. I am self-taught and I make mistakes. Having said that, I'm tired of survival crafting games being abandoned, focusing only on PvP and guns, or turning into major time sinks. I quit my day job in February of 2018 to focus on Solace Crafting full-time, and am doing everything I can to make a great fantasy survival RPG despite the tremendous challenge that is game development. Please don't buy into early access expecting a fully polished AAA game and then give it a bad review. In return, I promise to make sure that this game is never abandoned. If sales are more than enough for me to survive, then I can hire more help. First and foremost I will always work to secure financial longevity and legal stability. I know a lot of fans of the survival genre are pretty jaded, myself included, after so many titles have lost their leadership, changed projects, or plain given up. I'm here every day hoping to heal that sore and would very much appreciate your $15 support if any of this interests you. There are months of frequent patch notes and forum discussions between me and players here on Steam as proof that I'm capable of more than a couple new items after weeks of silence, something far too common in game development! Multiplayer like single-player will be PvE oriented, and is currently in closed alpha. Early access ends when there is enough content to constitute selling the game without the above warning. Getting better every day thanks to player involvement!",,,,14.99,

									",English,NaN,"RPG,Early Access"," About This Game  Inspiration: The game is a classic western RPG inspired by the games from the 90s. Basically, it?€?s the kind of game I personally find missing nowadays. Light, fairy tale, epic, heroic and slightly humorous. One that does not take tons of hours to complete or require endless grind to progress. Something that caters to players like me who don?€?t have 80 hours to beat one game but still like to play and have a sort of nostalgia for the way games were made in the old days. It was inspired by Dungeon Master, Eye of The Beholder 2, Might & Magic 3-5, Crystals of Arborea (a not so well known prequel to Ishar series), GoldBox series (Champions of Krynn, Dark Queen of Krynn, etc). Core Design Choices: 1) Classic, 90 degree rotation, FPP, turn-based, tile movement RPG. 2) Party-based (7 party members assembled upon start). 3) Open world with a big overworld to explore. 4) Fast paced combat. Quick travel. Easy inventory management. No grind. 5) Light, fairy tale like fantasy, epic story about heroes on a noble quest. Mechanics: Mechanically it?€?s 100% turn based (so you can go and make tea in the middle of a fight) with grid movement and 90 degree rotation. All this is very fast paced, both combat and travel is really fast. The goal was to cut down the boring parts and flesh out the fun parts. Overall, the mechanics are pretty traditional and straightforward with modern additions like weightless bag combined with equipment encumbrance system. World and Storyline: Storyline is a fairy tale, mythical heroic fantasy. You are the good guys on a quest to fight the forces of evil. The world is non linear, with very few locked areas. You basically can go anywhere and do things in different order. In addition you can choose a different set of quests to finish the game (but those are not mutually exclusive, so you can finish all quests if you like). It?€?s more world driven than story driven. The priority was to make the world feel alive and let you explore it as you wish than follow a linear list of quests. The game starts when the royal wizard finds out about an old crown that belonged to the royal family for generations. Yet, strangely no one ever heard about the crown and there was just a single mention of it in the royal annals. Upon further study he discovered that there has been cast a powerful spell of forgetfulness of unknown origin which caused everyone in the whole land to forget the crown ever existed. Without knowing who or why someone went to such trouble to conceal the existence of the crown he decided to investigate it. He summoned a party of noble heroes and tasked them with finding whereabouts of the mysterious crown and the origin of the spell.

Full AI support - all scenarios can be played both offline and online identically, supporting up to 64 players or bots filling in for the players if required. Rich science fiction universe setting. Another space game? Well, we've been doing this a long time - AFF has been a rich universe of fiction and art since 2005. We made a Homeworld mod, and kept building from there. Work started on an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod, but was then ported over to UT3 in 2007, culminating in a 3rd place grand prize in 2009's MakeSomethingUnreal contest. Angels Fall First as a standalone game is, for us, a mission to enable the player to do as much as possible in a vast environment - whilst still retaining the focussed, fun experience of match based FPS games. Way back in the back-whens, we loved Tie Fighter. A little later on, we loved Battlefield. We waited patiently for the game which would inevitably unite the vast scale and spacefights with the close and personal firefights and thunderous vehicle battles... But it never really appeared. Many games came close, but there was always some part missing. You couldn?€?t get out of your spaceship, you couldn?€?t get into your spaceship, you had big spaceships but you couldn?€?t run around in them, you could run around in your big spaceship but you couldn?€?t fly it and so on and so forth and gahd damMIT! Where was our spacefight groundfight game? So, we set ourselves to work. AFF exists because it MUST exist. Only in AFF can you spawn in your crew quarters, run to the bay watching the space fight out of the windows, launch a dropship, fight through the defenders to the enemy flagship, breach the hull, run and gun your way to the bridge and SHOOT THE ENEMY CAPTAIN IN THE BACK OF THE NECK. Calm Down! Ok. But it's this slightly twitchy passion which has driven us to create such a monster. We grew old making this, and we got grumpy watching everyone else release their cool games or whatever. We're from a time when games were about blowing stuff up for points and glory and now FINALLY we want to go out there and share this crazy passion with all of you!",,"Minimum:,OS:,Windows 7,Processor:,Dual Core 2ghz,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Nvidia 400 series or later,DirectX:,Version 9.0c,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,10 GB available space,Sound Card:,A little bit of imagination","Recommended:,OS:,Windows 7 or Later,Processor:,Quad Core 2.8ghz,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Nvidia 600 series or later,DirectX:,Version 9.0c,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,20 GB available space,Sound Card:,Fancy Soundcard",17.99,

									",English,25,"Adventure,Casual,Indie"," About This Game Play as ?€?Doctor?€? Simon Forman - unlicensed medical professional and astrologer - and help him win a medical licence. Astrologaster is a narrative-based comedy game. Explore Forman?€?s life, his work, and his relationships with his clients. Make story choices by performing astrological readings. Choose strategically or make decisions just for fun - but be aware that your choices will have consequences (and unpredictable side effects!) 13 clients come to see you 5-7 times seeking advice for personal, professional and medical problems. By examining the stars in the sky, you diagnose and determine answers for your clients?€? problems. As well as affecting the storyline, these choices will alter your clients?€? satisfaction levels. Satisfied clients will write you letters of recommendation, and with enough of these letters you can obtain a medical licence from the University of Cambridge. So-called ?€?real?€? (licensed) doctors call Forman a quack and fraud. Help Forman prove these medical establishment elitists wrong! Features Perform real* astrology: Examine the sky and choose astrological interpretations that Forman will use to advise his patients. (But remember: astrology is not an exact science!) Solve Hilarious Problems: Consult on problems ranging from Elizabethan terror plots and foul diseases, to romantic entanglements and stolen pies! Change Lives: Win your patients?€? favour or ruin their lives. Advise 14 characters who return 5-7 times. Patients have their own ongoing stories which often overlap with each other. Use gossip from some characters to guide and manipulate others. Win A Medical Licence: Convince patients to write letters of recommendations. Collect enough letters to exchange them for a medical licence. Fully Voiced Character Dialogue: Sitcom-style comedy brought to life by a cast of over a dozen actors. Sing Along: Enjoy Renaissance-era music and sing along to each character?€?s theme song. Casebooks Come Alive: Simon Forman?€?s cases are presented as a beautiful pop-up book. Turn pages to delve deeper into your patients?€? stories. The Story London, 1592. A great plague sweeps through the capital. When doctors flee the city in fear, a hero rises. His name is Simon Forman, ?€?Doctor?€? of Astrology, Astronomy and Physick. Not only does he have the power to cure the sick, he can find their lost pets and predict their futures! All by reading the movements of the stars. But when the plague ends, Forman?€?s problems begin. The real doctors return to London and they will stop at nothing to bring him down... Summary Astrologaster is a story-driven astrological comedy game set in Shakespeare?€?s London. Based on a true - and truly ridiculous - story. Simon Forman was considered a sage by some and a charlatan by others. What will your legacy be? Will you put your faith in the stars?",,"Minimum:,OS:,Windows 8,Processor:,Intel i3/i5/i7 dual core or equivalent,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Open GL 2.1 compatible card,Storage:,2 GB available space,Sound Card:,Yes,Minimum:,OS:,macOS 10.12 - Sierra,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Open GL 2.1 compatible card,Storage:,700 MB available space,Sound Card:,Yes","Recommended:,OS:,Windows 10,Processor:,Intel i5 quad core,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Open GL 3.2 compatible card,Storage:,2 GB available space,Sound Card:,Yes,Recommended:,OS:,macOS 10.14 - Mojave,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,Open GL 3.2 compatible card,Storage:,700 MB available space,Sound Card:,Yes",9.99,

TACTICAL ACTION COMBAT Sneak, aim for bodyparts, use varied weapons and ammo, trick and flank your enemies, set or disarm traps, drive and repair vehicles, and try not to blow up all of your teammates! Seriously, don??t take that bazooka into close quarters combat. A VARIETY OF GAMEMODES A typical game session is anywhere between 10 minutes and 1.5 hours, strongly depending on which gamemode and map you play. Large cooperative or solo maps take longer (if you don??t die), while competitive matches are usually timed at 10-20 minutes. CREATE AND TWEAK YOUR CUSTOM CHARACTERS No fixed classes, no pay-to-win!

PLAY AS A DOG Dogs are great support units who can throw grenades, drive cars, deploy turrets, fire mounted car guns, heal people (bring your DOGtor!), repair stuff, bite enemies in the butt, and more..

Powering down :( CLUSTERFUN! Nothing feels as good as killing your enemy with a toilet plunger fired from your compound bow right at his face.

Waking up in a strange room with little memory of how she came to be there, a young woman makes the shocking discovery she has lost her sense of sight. Goaded by the sinister and twisted Warden, she must explore a perverse and frightening mansion using sound alone. By sending out soundwaves with a cane, the outlines of objects are briefly revealed, enabling the player to navigate the mansion, solve puzzles and uncover the mystery of what is happening to her. As she gets closer and closer to the truth, however, she will be forced to confront her worst enemy--that which she does not, or will not see.  Born out of the Global Game Jam in 2014, which had the theme of ?€?We don?€?t see things as they are, we see them as we are?€?, the Blind team won the Best Game award at the Turin (Italy) jam site with their entry Come to See My House. The team then began work on a full game based on this initial concept. Built from the ground up for virtual reality, Blind will be launching September 18, 2018. Learn to navigate carefully and cautiously using your cane. Send out soundwaves to reveal your surroundings briefly before they fade into darkness. Gramophones and other objects that make sound become lighthouses in the all-encompassing blackness. Built from the ground up for virtual reality and supporting binaural audio and motion control, Blind is a fully immersive and unique experience that removes you from the world you are used to, and asks you to see things differently. Where are you? Who is the Warden? Why has he kidnapped you and why does he want you to solve the puzzles in this strange and yet somehow eerily familiar place? Experience a constant sense of foreboding and emotional tension as you travel deeper into a mansion riddled with puzzles and dangers.

Advanced technology lets you and your friends clone your avatars so death is not the end. Teleport into new sectors of space, discovering the ever-changing, procedurally generated layouts and hazards filled with strange beings and alien environments. Find dozens of advanced weapon components scattered throughout diverse galaxy biomes. Combine the pieces as you see fit to create the strongest weapon in the universe. Choose from a variety of unlockable ships and pilots and prove your skills against alien ships and bosses in the far reaches of space. Last Encounter does not have predefined weapons. Dr. Daniel Connor has found a way to use alien technology through a unique component based weapon system. Research enables you to combine components into deadly designs, like Homing Gatling Rockets, Poison Flak Shells or the Triple Bouncing Laser Beam on the image above. What components will you find in the depths of space? What weapons will you craft? Your mission sends you into deep space, many galaxies from home. Since not every pilot makes it back, or very far to be honest, Dr. Connor has a cloning device which lets him create new pilots to send on the mission. The problem with the portals though is that they are unreliable. You will end up in the same galaxies, most likely. But that does not mean they?€?ll be familiar. Every time you jump through a portal you?€?ll be in a galaxy sector you most likely have not seen before On your journey deep into unexplored sectors you will encounter both human remains and alien species. These strange beings might join you on your adventure and grow your pool of available pilots. Each pilot comes with their special traits. Some of them rely on speed and agility, while others prefer raw force. Besides pilots, you?€?ll also be growing your collection of space crafts in your home base. Ships have varied hulls and shields. But what mostly makes them apart are their special abilities. Cloaking devices, EMP bombs, Weapon Augmentations, you name it! Alien weaponry systems hold dozens of weapon components which can be designed into hundreds of weapons. With the various weapon systems, pilots and ships there are thousands of combinations you can use to your advantage, or doom. Although it?€?s perfectly acceptable for you to take on the mission by yourself, if you do prefer company, you can team up with three more pilots in local co-op. The friendly pilots will join in on your mission wherever you left off. You?€?ll be sharing the same progress, money pool and technology resources on your adventure into the unknown.

As a lowly cleaning robot, your task is to gather precious materials from each world before the solar system goes kaboom. As soon as you land, you realize this gig isn't going to be as simple as you had hoped. During the day you'll scramble to gather resources, build structures and keep your base in good repair. But when it gets dark, get ready to fight. Those rampaging wild robots aren't here to have a knitting competition. At least you're not alone in your daily chores. Fleshy, unintelligent and very unattractive human creatures live on these planets. You've discovered they're quite amenable to being told what to do, even if those tasks are as limited as carrying resources back and forth. Mix some DNA from a few different species, however, and you can breed humans with special powers. Like, say... laser beam eyes! A little mod here, a little hack there and they might turn out to be quite useful! Features  Fuse alien and human DNA: Create hybrids with special alien abilities by mixing DNA from two different meatbags. A human is useful, but a human with a laser eyes, and a new pair of arms is even more useful.  Build offensive and defensive structures: Hold back the wild robot hordes while simultaneously pummeling them with lasers, missiles, bolts of electricity and your very own personal attack drones. 15 unique structures to create and upgrade.  Enhance your base with technology: Influence the battlefield and manage your base with nine different pieces of buildable technology. Need to heal yourself? There's tech for that. Want to build drones? Tech for that, too!  Motivate your meatbags: The humans usually do what you ask. Unless they're tired or bored or just plain apathetic. Fortunately there's plenty of alien biotechnology you can implant to give them a little encouragement.  Robotic enemies: Nobody knows where the wild robots come from, but they sure are well-armed. Eight unique enemy types that range from creepy crawly things to dashy explodey things.  Boss robots: Three sinister bad guys to take out with your turrets. One of them has a giant brain.
