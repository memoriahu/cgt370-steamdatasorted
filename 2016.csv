And, of course, the age-old tale of an evil madman with the nefarious plan of turning old people into delicious hot dogs. Mr. B is kidnapping old people and turning them into hot dogs! It's up to you and your best buds, Mr. Rock and Sparkles the Giraffe, to save the day. Leap, slash, and blast your way through increasingly madcap levels. Along the way you'll help a whale regain confidence, take a side in the battle between toast and dinosaurs, and travel to a legendary sunken city to decide the result of a Pirate election. Inspired by classic platformers and cartoons alike, The Adventure Pals is a mixture of lovingly handcrafted platformer levels, combat focused arenas, and unique locations with townsfolk who provide quests, items, and other goodies to aid you on your journey. Just like your favorite peanut butter and jelly sandwich, The Adventure Pals is both nutty and sweet, with perhaps just a little crunch. Explore five distinct worlds, all with their own unique characters and quests. Level up by defeating baddies to improve your health, stabbin', or rock-smashin'. Gameplay that's easy to pick up, but ramps up the challenge as you go. A fun and funny story with a bizarre but lovable cast and hilarious cartoon cutscenes. Play by yourself, or with a bestie in co-op mode. Three words: Giraffe. Helicopter. Tongue. This is you! One minute it?€?s your birthday, the next your Papa is being stolen from you right before your eyes! Thrust into the role of adventurer, you quickly realize that you are a natural at this baddie-bashing, grapple-swinging, toaster-popping, quest-completing, experience-leveling, treasure-seeking malarky. But will you be able to rescue your Papa and stop Mr B?€?s diabolical plans in time? Friend. Philosopher. MENSA member. Giraffe. Sparkles has many talents beyond being a mere mount. Use her not-at-all-creepy helicopter-like tongue to slow and direct your fall, or her long neck to yank yourself to distant enemies for devastating combo finishers, or up to those hard-to-reach platforms to, y?€?know... jump higher. When you need somebody sturdy you can lean on for support, call Mr. Rock, because, well... he's a literal rock. Maybe he's a bit of a smart-aleck, but don't take him for granite - you?€?ll discover he has some pretty awesome abilities to unlock as you adventure through the game.",,,,14.99

In this tale, you play as a loyal servant of the hero rather than the hero herself. Travel by Princess Loren's side as she searches for her lost mother, the Queen of the Amazons. Guide her choices and act as her valiant defender, meeting many colorful characters along the way. As the journey progresses, everyone will grow and change -- character development in games isn't dead! It's also impossible to see all the content in just one playthrough, with so many ways to customize the characters. Hardcore role-playing games with replay value are becoming rarer in today's age of simplification for the masses. The developers of the hit title Planet Stronghold have dedicated themselves to keeping old-school RPGs alive through this new adventure. Game Features Customize Your Hero: Play as a male or female warrior or thief. Decide their backstory, initial stats, and personality. Help them rise from humble servant to legendary hero! Train Your Characters: Select everyone's skills, weapons, and armor. Over 500 items can be used in 13 armor slots. Class-based skill trees combine with unique character-specific skill trees such as ""Gladiator"" or ""Assassin"". Battles Demand Strategy: Your tactics will be challenged by over 100 enemies: take advantage of weaknesses and achieve combos with your characters by inflicting and then exploiting status effects. All that character customization has a major effect on how each battle plays out. But never fear: choose between two different modes of play when you start the game, as well as your desired difficulty level. Story-based Gameplay: Over two novels' worth of in-game text depict vivid characters and flesh out a strong plot that reflects your decisions. Optional interactions abound, such as talking with your party members at camp to learn more about them -- or even to uncover a romance. Inclusive to all demographics. A wide range of romantic interests are provided. Theme song composed by Matthew Myers and performed by Christina Vee,  game soundtrack by Michael Chait.

A totalitarian State controls every aspect of private and public life. Laws are oppressive. Surveillance is total. Privacy is dead. You are the State-installed manager of an apartment building.

Your primary task is to covertly watch your tenants and eavesdrop on their conversations.

You must also REPORT anyone capable of violating the laws or plotting subversive activities against the State to the authorities.  You are a cog in a totalitarian machine!

For the past 495 years, a secluded island village has adhered to bloody yet sacred traditions. They speak of a sleeping God beneath the waves, whose awakening shall birth a new era for the worthy. In this cult manager, there are sinners aplenty, and not all are eager to confess. Each member of your community has 2 hidden traits - one virtuous, one heretical. If you?€?ve earned the favor of their House, you may investigate their reputation. Be alert as you may find strange occurrences among your devotees due to a new mysterious contagion . Ensure you lock the infected away and allow the salt water to wash away their sins. Otherwise, you may appoint them to your seasonal council and watch their work for clues. Five powerful aristocratic families help maintain the village, seeking salvation through book burning, monument building, and heretical investigations. Choose one advisor from each family to assist in their ancient appointed task. However, every season, you must make the ultimate choice, designating a human sacrifice. Closely examine your citizenry to find the best strategy for your people and beliefs, knowing that nobody wants their child sacrificed, even for the greater good. When our Lord awakens, will He find you worthy? The five families of The Shrouded Isle each supervise a different aspect of the community. Be cautious, as their loyalties are fickle as the tide. House Kegnni manages the farmlands of the village, and is charged with protecting the sacred ignorance of the community. Matron Kegnni trains her sons and daughters in the art of book-burning, erasing any trace of the old world and its many sins. House Iosefka are the village builders, using carpentry and masonry to create grand structures that ensure our Fervor may never be extinguished. Adjudicator Iosefka has designed a variety of monuments over the years, and is said to favor pyromaniacs, as their ritual fires burn brightest. House Efferson are the judges of our souls, wielding the whips that punish sinners and ensure Penitence. To confess to Vicar Efferson is to discover the newest and most effective flagellation techniques to appease our Lord. House Cadwell carefully count the wealth of the village, made up primarily of merchants and miners, and enforce Discipline. Lord Cadwell and his sons and daughters scour the village for forbidden delights that might distract from prayer and (we trust) dispose of them appropriately. Everyone in the village dreads House Blackborn, the guards and enforcers of Obedience. Stories abound of the dungeons of Inquisitor Blackborn, but lawful, peace-keeping citizens have nothing to fear.

Although half of the town's citizens support the building of such a mill, the other half fear the potential for pollution and contamination of their beloved river. Recognizing Ohitoyo's budgetary decline over the last few decades, Sotetsu believes that the town requires a system that allows it to be fiscally independent instead of reliant upon a factory to stimulate its economy, and sets out to identify an alternative method in achieving this goal. It's during this time that Sotetsu comes across an android-like being--a ""Raillord"" named Hachiroku--while looking through his late adoptive father's belongings. Although inanimate, Hachiroku and Sotetsu forge a deep, unlikely connection, and from this bond, work together in hopes of restoring Ohitoyo to its former glory.

Amongst its crumbling ruins, forsaken souls, angelic creatures and demons alike have run amok. Only a courageous hero that dares to venture deep into the Afterlife will be able to restore Harmony. A VR shooter with roguelike elements, In Death??s surreal medieval setting is presented in a procedurally generated world with monsters, mysteries and loot. Driven by an achievement-based progression system that advances between sessions, each run is unique, with unpredictable outcomes. Features and Highlights: A VR Shooter with Roguelike elements: Inspired by classic Roguelike dungeon crawlers, In Death pays homage to this merciless genre favoured by core gamers. With no save points, each procedurally generated run uses a random seed to generate the map with randomized enemy and loot spawn points. Game progression is driven by an achievement system that persists across each run and scales the difficulty level of the game in lockstep with your mastery of it. Ranged Combat, Perfected: Make intense kills with your longbow, while using your shield to both block ranged attacks or defend against short-range melee threats. Shield bash enemies threatening to swarm you and buy yourself precious time for that short-range headshot. Upgrade your bow with a host of special arrows gained by looting monsters, finding pick-ups or by visiting in-level Reliquaries where you can power up with a range of intense special arrows to help you blast through ever harsher enemy encounters. Unique locomotion system: In Death introduces an innovative, fresh movement system tailored for VR comfort and perfectly coupled with your fighting stance. Switch instantly from combat arrows to a magic teleport arrow to navigate anywhere you can shoot. If you prefer, throw the single-handed teleport shard to perform short strafes, dash around corners or quickly retreat from overwhelming opposition. And if you prefer free movement, In Death allows you to opt for a classic free movement style of navigation that layers onto the primary combat locomotion afforded by your teleport arrow and shard. The choice is yours. Global, Cross Platform Leaderboards & Personal Stats: Fight your way to pole position on the global leaderboards, competing for placement in the all-time top 10 rankings or the 24 hour leaderboard. All VR players compete together, irrespective of their VR rig of choice. And track your own progress with statistics showing your current run stats against your personal  best performance. Beautiful, Medieval Setting: Powered by Unreal Engine, In Death pushes the boundaries of visual performance in VR. Optimized to scale performance to take the best possible advantage of your PC, we strive to bring a high level of visual polish to your experience, with more to come as we progress through Early Access to Full Release.

It easily counts 120+ hours of gameplay for the average player, and much more taking into account replayability. Story introduction: A dark tale, and a brave new world A century ago, the Andorian Empire was destroyed by a magical cataclysm that brought The Horrors into our world; humanity was nearly annihilated. Many thousand managed to escape sailing away to the Imperial Colony of Varannar: a savage island, dangerous and unexplored. Mistrust and blame made impossible to elect a new Emperor, and the four Exiled Kingdoms were proclaimed. Nowadays, the ragtag kingdoms still struggle to survive in a harsh land, often waging war on each other and slowly declining into barbarism. Empire and the Horrors are, for many, just old legends and fairytales. But as a novice adventurer you rarely pay attention to such old stories; you're more concerned with your latest misfortunes and chronically empty purse. But for once, luck seems to be on your side. A magical letter from New Garand materialized in your hands; it states that you are the sole beneficiary of a big inheritance. You don?€?t remember any relatives in the capital of the Kingdom of Varsilia, but certainly that won?€?t stop you from an opportunity like this! The road to New Garand will reveal many surprises, and will teach you that fairytales and legends can become, in fact, very real. Note about assets: part of the art used in the game, trailer and screenshots is shared under different open licenses.

That is central in Shelter 2, and one of the reasons we chose to make a game about a Lynx. They are in middle of the food chain, and there are far more vicious things out on the cold tundra. The game follows the life of a mother lynx, starting as a pregnant animal, giving birth and continuing in to a journey of parenthood where nurturing her cubs is paramount for survival. Shelter 2 includes more elaborate gameplay features than its predecessor, such as stamina, different types of movements, jumps and a variety of prey to kill. Besides hunting there are several maternal and hunting features, such as calling the cubs closer, smell for prey, making sure they drink water from rivers and lifting and carrying your cubs from harm?€?s way. A vast wilderness awaits Environments in Shelter 2 are much bigger than its predecessor and allow a lot more freedom than ever before, allowing players to find favorite spots to return to. This time weather and seasons change, harsh winters and bloomy summers awaits you! The music is once again presented by Retro Family, awarded for their work on the Pid Soundtrack, and the visuals have been reinvented by adding dense atmosphere and lighting to the patterned graphical art style.

Among other entries in the genre such as Ib and Ao Oni, The Witch?€?s House surprised fans with pixel-art that conceals truly frightening horror. The Witch?€?s House is deliberately designed with traps at *almost* every turn--sudden death is unpredictable and it keeps players on their toes. Anything can happen at any time. With completely remastered visuals, The Witch?€?s House MV will feel fresh to even the most familiar old-school fans. Fans will also be greeted by a new difficulty mode that includes new events upon completion of the base game. A horror atmosphere wherein players solve puzzles based on clues found in the house. Completely reimagined graphics that make for a beautifully terrifying experience. Brand new unlockable difficulty mode with new events and dialogue. Violence and gore that are not recommended for the squeamish. Player discretion advised. Sudden deaths that lurk around every corner and await every misstep. Items must be used deliberately as players solve the puzzles for themselves. Fixed save points (just keep an eye out for the talking black cat). Game pads are supporting and recommended. Head phones *strongly* recommended. Hello. I'm Fummy, creator of The Witch's House MV. I'm happy to announce that we're finally ready to release the game. The Witch's House MV is an RPG Maker MV remake of the original game, which was released back in 2012. We remade all the graphics, including map tiles and character sprites, and worked hard to enhance the atmosphere and 2D beauty in The Witch's House. It took us five times as many hours to create this version, but we feel like we've finally managed to satisfy ourselves. Aside from graphical improvements, we also added two new difficulty settings that was not present in the free version. The first difficulty setting is a more accessible one that allows you to instantly retry. The other difficulty setting is a more difficult one which is only unlocked by those who manage to reach the game's true ending. ""The normal difficulty isn't enough to satisfy me..."" ""I'm not averse to instantly dying upon reaching new areas."" If either of these describe you, then we recommend you give this new difficulty a try. You also may be able to uncover some new story bits concerning ""her""... The world of The Witch's House has been reborn anew, and we sincerely hope you'll all enjoy it. My name is Dan Stern and I?€?m the Scholar of the First Deal at DANGEN Entertainment (sounds fancy, but it means I work with the devs to get their games released so you can play them). Japan has a longer tradition in 16-bit horror games because of the variety of games that was released on the Super Famicom. But that wasn?€?t something I experienced because of growing up in the West. It wasn?€?t until I discovered The Witch?€?s House some years ago that I learned 16-bit games can scare me just as well as high-res AAA games made in 3D. I learned that even in pixel-art, horror is possible; it just depends on the creator?€?s mastery of atmosphere and timing. Fummy-san absolutely has that mastery and as silly as it sounds, I?€?ve never had so much fun dying a lot in a video game. I was ecstatic to find out that not only is there a remaster of my favorite indie horror classic, but that DANGEN could help to get that game in front of fans that I know will love it. Playing The Witch?€?s House MV feels like a totally new experience and I?€?m sure you?€?ll have fun with the new content after you finish your first playthrough. Cheers!",,,,14.99

Desert Out in the open fields of the desert you have excellent vision of enemy incoming from all directions. However, if you can see them they can see you. Here you can, and often will, be attacked from all directions. Choose your defensive locations carefully and be prepared to recommit forces quickly in order to maintain this position. A real challenge for any commander. Alpine Set high in the mountains at twilight, battle against an enemy in difficult conditions. Visibility is hard due to the falling light and your vision of enemies is hampered by the nearby forest.

You have a huge area in which to build your base, but sight lines up to your perimeter are tight. Beware of enemy snipers from across the water. An excellent environment for those with large play areas, but still enjoyable for those with not much room.

Beware also of enemy special forces flanking you on land or taking sniping positions above.

Building on a remarkable legacy with a host of exciting new features and a stunning visual makeover, Constructor Plus proudly takes this building behemoth of a game to even greater heights. Constructor Plus is the definitive building simulation for the modern day tycoon. With over 147 beautifully designed buildings to choose from (93 more than previous versions), a whopping 65 pre-built city scenarios with different gameplay objectives, brain-testing story mode missions and even the chance to develop out in the countryside or as far away as the moon, this is a huge and innovative playing landscape that stretches the imagination. Throw in a new and greatly improved classic mode for the traditionalist and an updated intuitive set up process and you?€?ll be building the town of your dreams in no time at all. It?€?s your world?€? now make it work for you! Start the game as a humble property developer with nothing and work up to being a big time property tycoon where what you build you earn from. Money and good management talks in the building game. Whether you choose to play by the book or delve into dodgy dealings is down to you, either way the more you have the more others want to take it from you. Wit, wealth and wisdom go a long way in a game where growing a thick skin is just as important as growing your empire! Use your entrepreneurial skills to turn simple wooden shacks into grand mansions, swanky casinos and towering skyscrapers with all the wealth that comes with it. With so many buildings to choose from you can make your town truly unique and highly desirable ?€? great for attracting tenants and encouraging business. Populating the city with grand commissions and breathtakingly beautiful monuments is a shrewd move - The local townsfolk will appreciate the breath of fresh air and generously donate pocket change and lunch money to your ?€?cause.?€? Your town is your profit and you?€?ll want to keep it that way - by whatever unscrupulous means necessary. With cheating landlords and bad tenants to laid-back hippies and angry thugs there?€?s a lot to deal with. You might want to call in the mob and all the undesirable characters that come with them to thwart enemies intent on running you out of town and taking your hard earned away from you. Giant mutant cockroaches and local hit men can prove useful allies! You still have a responsible job to do and, depending on the goals you have chosen (or have been assigned!) you will need to ensure that your city is up to scratch. At the end of the day if you?€?re running your town into the ground the Housing Authority are going to step in and give you the boot. Constructor Plus ?€?

Death comes swiftly ?€? for the lucky ones ?€? and for those still living, grief is a constant companion. Ry??bi and Ry??na, two shinobi sisters of the Hebijo Clandestine Girls?€? Academy elite, know that truth all too well, and they mourn their beloved elder sister every day. But when a mystical phenomenon appears, drawing the shinobi world?€?s finest young ladies into a parallel dimension, everything they know about life and death turns upside down. Taken to a strange world resembling a warm summer island, the girls find themselves face to face with their departed loved ones. The island?€?s mysterious mistresses challenge the girls, who hail from four different rival schools, to a contest of strength and wits. The winning school, so they promise, will not only learn the highest secrets of shinobi lore, but will also have the honor of laying their loved ones?€? souls to rest. The buxom beauties prepare for a new kind of battle, facing not only their rivals, but questions galore. Can the islands?€? hosts be trusted? Will the other schools play fair, team up, or cheat? Will there be time to enjoy the beach before the fighting starts? Will anyone manage to keep their clothes intact?

Save and invest, steal and extort, arrest and get arrested ?€? in single-player and multiplayer, with ranks and ladders, team mode and spectator mode. Featuring seasonal content updates, regular tournaments, item drops, full support of Steam Community Market ?€? and more! HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME? Gremlins, Inc. is designed for up to 6 players, in multiplayer or in single-player mode (with AI bots). Each player has 6 cards on their hand (replenished from the same deck) and uses them either to move around the playing field or to perform different game actions. There is a lot of interaction with other players, and duels are significantly different from 3-player or 4-player games. You can play until a certain score limit, or until agreed number of rounds, or for time limit. The game offers both custom and ranked sessions (with matchmaking by rating). CAN YOU PLAY IN TEAMS OR JUST WATCH? Yes, you can! In addition to custom sessions (where you define the parameters of the session and may optionally set filters for those who can join you) and password-protected private sessions (so that you and your friends can play undisturbed), the game offers team mode (2x2, 3x3, or 2x2x2) with teams of human players and/or AI bots. Gremlins, Inc. also supports a built-in spectator mode , which allows you to watch sessions of other players right from inside of the game, sharing your emotions with players and other spectators through messages and emoticons. CAN YOU PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE? Certainly! When you buy this game, you get 2 products in your Steam Library: Gremlins, Inc. ?€? the edition that is playable online in single-player and multiplayer modes, with full support of item drops and Steam Workshop; and Gremlins vs Automatons ?€? the edition that is playable offline in single-player mode, without any connection to our server whatsoever. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE SESSION? The game offers different session settings to make them fit your available time, and single-player mode offers automatic SAVE / LOAD function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you want (while multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast timer can finish in under 20 minutes, while a 4-player session for 60 rounds can last for 2 hours or more. SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES? There are different types of cards in the game (permanent, regular, secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either to move or for action, you will develop both short-term and long-term strategies for making the most out of where you are, and what you currently have in your hand. Normally, you spend half of your game time accumulating resources and building the foundation for the end-game, and the other half trying to control the progress of your opponents (stealing, arresting, initiating player conflicts, and so on). The more you play, the more new strategies you will discover ?€? especially when combining the effects of several cards played in a combination. MAKE DECISIONS, PLAN YOUR MOVES This is an intense strategy game : make decisions at every round! Plan your moves, then adjust to the actions of the other players and new cards drawn. The design of the playing field and the multiple layers of optional features (that you can turn on or off, as you wish) allow for a variety of strategies. The more you play, the more roads to victory you discover, using a combination of features based on the particular setup of the session. The game offers a diverse resource system that allows for many comeback chances even after you're robbed or arrested (or both). With score, money, votes, malice, income and bribes, the tension often remains until the very last round. The multilayer mode of the game features a system of ratings , ladders and ranked sessions : compete in a specific league, and take part in the regularly organised tournaments with over 1 000 participants. A system of anonymous masks allows everyone to compete on equal terms in a ranked session. Every season since its release in 2016, the game receives FREE content and feature updates (balancing changes, new cards, new in-game items, new music). We are committed to continue developing this product ?€???based on player feedback! Additionally, the game offers over 10 single-player challenges plus the option to create custom single-player sessions with different settings and a different mix of AI bots. Finally, there's the team mode where victory is determined not only by strategic skill, but also by communication and coordination of each team, which is an entirely different layer of game mechanics. FACTS & FIGURES 185 cards in the main deck (149 of them ?€???unique): permanent, regular, secret and criminal, each with a hand-drawn steampunk illustration; with each Season update, we keep adding several new cards to the deck. 39 events in the Misfortune deck : these are the special events triggered at certain moments in the game, and may affect the current standing of all players to a significant degree, especially when used on a specific opponent. 6 special Chaos Cards : this is an optional set of cards available to every player in the game; turn them on or off to change the dynamics of the session. 12 sets of Character Abilities : another optional feature that brings to the game special game mechanics unique to each character type; playing with these makes different competing strategies even more pronounced. 11 original locations : the Office, the Plant, the Dump, the Marketplace, the Inferno, the Jail, the Casino, the Court, the Treasure, the Bank and the Astral Plane; and 7 original spot types : Risk, Gamble, Police, Income, Bribe, Misfortune and Tribune. 2 distinctly different playing fields : The Clockwork Town and The Clockwork Colony, each offering strategic challenges of their own. Finally, the game took us three years to develop from concept to full release, and we're still committed to continue supporting the community through development of new content. There are currently over 150 000 players of Gremlins, Inc. on Steam from all over the world, including USA, Russia, China, Japan, UK and France. Collectively, players already launched several millions game sessions! FINALLY, WHO ARE THE GREMLINS? You think that?€?s just a pocket watch in your hand, a watch that?€?s a bit late because you keep forgetting to wind it up? No, no and no ?€? you couldn?€?t be further from the truth! What you carry around is a whole gremlin town packed into this tiny mechanism: a town with its own bank, its own casino?€? and even its own jail! Gremlins are the microscopic creatures that inhabit any mechanism that they can possibly infiltrate. If a watch or a telescope malfunctions, then it?€?s probably due to gremlins who took up a residence there. More than anything in life, gremlins value money , political power and prestige : prestige that one can claim after completing some sort of a grandiose engineering project. Aside from working on their own projects, gremlins mostly spend their time preventing other gremlins from building something even more grandiose. This they achieve through bribing officials and lying to the electorate, as well through stealing from their competitors - and outright arresting them. A DISCLAIMER (JUST IN CASE) We felt it important to note that Gremlins, Inc. is not a free-to-play game. Also, this is not a CCG or TCG: you do not need to buy boosters or packs; in every session the game offers the same deck to every player, and everyone's chances are equal. OUR DLC POLICY We are committed to the principle of continuously updating the game with new features and new game content that come as regular updates, FREE to every owner of the product. At the same time, from time to time we release DLCs that feature fun cosmetic content. If you like it, you can support our efforts by your purchase. However, there is absolutely no pressure to own any of the DLCs in order to play the game or compete in the tournaments. Every player, whether they have DLCs or not, has access to the same game features and the same game mechanics. STEAM COMMUNITY MARKET, CRAFTING AND ITEM STORE Gremlins, Inc. features in-game items and fully supports Steam Community Market . While playing the game, certain actions will trigger random chest drops with items of varying rarity: it could be a new emoticon, a new profile background, a new music track, or one of the dozens of other cosmetic items. These items are FREE, yours to use or trade on Steam Community Market . We, the developer, do not engage in the direct sales of any drop items; only players can trade them. The game also supports crafting : once you find a blueprint of a specific item, you can create as many such items as you wish, as long as you have the required number of charges (you get charges when you convert other in-game items that you do not want, or have multiple copies of). Finally, the game has its own Steam Item Store where we sell a very small number of unique items that influence the item meta-game (but they have no effect on the game mechanics). ONLINE & OFFLINE VERSIONS Gremlins, Inc. was designed as a digital board game with the multiplayer mode at its heart. However, this is not to say that we don't like single-player ?€???we do, and there's a separate section with the single-player challenges as well as the mode where you can create any custom single-player session that you like! One of the products that you receive with this game, Gremlins, Inc. , features both single-player and multiplayer modes, and requires that your game client is connected to both Steam and the game's server at all times ?€???in order to support item drops, Steam Community Market and Steam Workshop. The other product that is included with the game, Gremlins vs Automatons , features single-player mode and is designed specifically to be played offline. AMSTERDAM AND SINGAPORE SERVERS The game currently supports 2 separate servers: Amsterdam and Singapore. Players are able to check their ping value for each of these servers, and play on the server that is the most convenient. Each server has its own player ladder, statistics and player profiles. Most players choose Amsterdam, since ping to Amsterdam from anywhere in the world rarely exceeds 300. However, as we saw more and more players from the Asian region join the game, especially from China, we added the server in Singapore in order to be able to offer faster connection specifically to these players. We hope that this works well for every player, as good player experience is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the quality of our server/client connection in order to adapt the servers to the changing requirements and we thank you for your patience.",,"Minimum:,OS:,XP,Processor:,Intel Pentium,Memory:,2 GB RAM,Graphics:,Intel Iris 4800,DirectX:,Version 9.0,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,1 GB available space,Sound Card:,internal,Minimum:,OS:,MacOS,Processor:,Intel Pentium,Memory:,2 GB RAM,Graphics:,internal,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,1 GB available space,Sound Card:,internal,Minimum:,OS:,Ubuntu 12.04,Processor:,Intel Pentium,Memory:,2 GB RAM,Graphics:,internal,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,1 GB available space,Sound Card:,internal","Recommended:,OS:,7, 8, 10,Processor:,Intel Pentium 3+ generation,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,GeForce 9XX or AMD,DirectX:,Version 9.0,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,1 GB available space,Sound Card:,internal,Recommended:,OS:,10+,Processor:,Intel Pentium 3+ generation,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Geforce 9XX or AMD,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,1 GB available space,Sound Card:,internal,Recommended:,OS:,Ubuntu 12.04+,Processor:,Intel Pentium 3+ generation,Memory:,4 GB RAM,Graphics:,Geforce 9XX or AMD,Network:,Broadband Internet connection,Storage:,1 GB available space,Sound Card:,internal",14.99

Granny keeps you locked in her house and she will not let you go. You wake up in a dark room, you have a headache and it feels like someone have hit you in the head. The only thing that lights up the room is your flashlight lying on a table.  The main door is covered with different locks and now you have to search the house and find keys and other objects to unlock the door and escape this house. But you have to be careful because Granny hears everything and if you drop something on the floor or walking on a creaking floor she will start running to the place she heard that sound. You also need to watch out for her bear traps and other things lurking in the dark, like her pets, for example. You can hide in wardrobes and coffins but be careful that she does not see you where you are hiding.  There is another way to escape. At the bottom of this house there is a garage. In the garage there is an old car. If you manage to start it and open the garage door you can escape that way.  You can protect yourself from Granny using one of the two different types of weapons you can find in the house. But it only stops her for a while. But it's worth it.  There are five different levels of difficulty. Extreme, Hard, Normal, Easy and Practice. If you play in Practice mode, you are in the house without Granny and have the opportunity to try different things without major difficulties. But the house is not completely free from dangers.  Granny gives you five days in the house but you can earn a extra day if you do something for her. If you have failed to escape after the last day... well, probably you can figure out what happens then.   Good luck!", Mature Content Description  The developers describe the content like this:  The game Granny contains dark and scary sounds. The game also contains mild violence and blood splash.  ,,,4.99

Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Spinal Tap, it?€?s a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving humanity and Heavy metal tunes. Featuring the talents of comedian, actor and musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by some of the biggest names in metal music it's a wild ride in the belly of the beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike.  Included as a free bonus in the PC version of Br??tal Legend are both the Hammer of Infinite Fate and Tears of the Hextadon multiplayer map packs. Story The vivid and wildly creative world of Br??tal Legend is brought to life through a spate of chrome, leather, rocker babes, epic music, fire-breathing/stud-wearing beasts, mountains made of guitar amps, and more. Follow Eddie as he embarks on a tour of epic destruction with an axe, a guitar, and his minions as he commands the power of rock in epic band battles. It?€?s lighter-flicking awesomeness that will melt your face clean off. Combat Br??tal Legend?€?s combat is a combination of classic action slasher and real time strategy mechanics.  Melee and ranged combat come from your double-sided broadaxe and demon-slaying, pyrotechnic-creating guitar.  Add that 1-2 punch to a guitar solo mechanic that can summon objects, buff your teammates, or cripple your opponents, and you have a deep, gratifying core gameplay combat loop that is fun for the hardcore and accessible for the casual.  On top of that, players will journey from Roadie to Rock God by commanding legions of metalheads into Br??tal Victory and sending troops charging into battle. A Streaming Open World Br??tal Legend gives you the freedom to walk, drive, or fly anywhere in a fully streaming open world whose art style is inspired by some of the most iconic and hilariously rad metal album covers ever created. Every vista in the beautiful universe of Br??tal Legend looks like it was pulled from a Frank Frazetta painting. Packed With Cameos and Voice Talent Br??tal Legend is full of cameos from gods of metal like Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, and many, many others. It has a MASSIVE metal soundtrack from every era of metal music: 1970?€?s classic metal to 1980?€?s hair metal to the scarier cousins of 1990?€?s metal. And of course, Jack Black pays the ultimate homage to metal as Eddie the Roadie, continuing the theme from the work of his band, Tenacious D and his previous films like School of Rock and High Fidelity. Multiplayer Mayhem 4v4 ""skirmish"" multiplayer marries action combat with a strategic unit-control mechanic.

The game might appear simple at first, but it is full of depth, details and of course monsters.  The main focus in CoE4 is that each race plays differently. We're not talking about a unique building and unique unit, we're talking about completely differently, with different mechanics and different goals. Perhaps you're playing a druid, focused on amassing a vast forest and jungle empire from which to harvest ingredients to summon creatures of the woods with no practical need to conquer mines. Perhaps you're a dwarf, who's only concern are mines and produce units at a set rate every turn, focused almost entirely on upgrading those units to survive as long as possible since they are so difficult to replace. With 20 different factions that alone is enough to keep your play dynamic as you vie for control of the map to conquer Elysium.  New for the 4th version of Conquest of Elysium is the addition of different planes, many new rituals, monster descriptions, a completely new battle system, new random maps with varying temperatures and much more.  The game has six different planes. There is for instance an Infernal plane that is the home of the devils and the demons. So if a demonologist manages to summon a demon lord, there will suddenly be a dark citadel without its master in inferno. Banishing a devil will now force it back to inferno instead of slaying it permanently. Although extremely difficult it is possible to permanently destroy a demon lord by storming inferno and slaying it on that plane. Although there are many planes now you will only rarely have to visit them. But they continue to run in the background and can make certain actions or random events more exciting.  Most factions start with a random set of rituals, a random set of combat spell and together with the random map that will ensure that no two games are the same. More rituals and spells can be learned during the game if you have the right resources and find the right locations. In addition to the aggressive wildlife of Elysium there's also random events to contend with, from bumper harvests and bandits, to the very gates of the underworld opening into Elysium. Your hands will be full before you even make contact with the enemy.",,,,24.99

Search inside ancient ruins, seeking out the ?€?Secret Treasure of Life?€? ?€? which sleeps in the sprawling ruins of ?€?LA-MULANA?€? and is said to be the beginning of all civilization. Unfortunately, priceless artifacts very rarely give themselves up easily. Apart from the plethora of traps lying in wait, there are also monsters on the prowl, protecting the ruins. Head for the innermost depths of the ruins while solving a variety of mysteries, fending off monsters, and disarming traps. Forging ahead will be no simple task ?€? the further into the depths you reach, the more difficult the mysteries become. The guardians of LA-MULANA do not take their job lightly. LA-MULANA on Steam is the PC port version of the acclaimed remake for WiiWare. One of the first NIGORO games, LA-MULANA was originally created back in the creators?€? ?€?amateur?€? days and has been renown worldwide. This game was created based on ?€?that old-time feeling.?€? The creators wished to play the sort of games that enthralled them back in the day, only with more volume. The operability and difficulty level are certainly not ?€?new school?€?. However, this game is highly recommended to gamers seeking out that feeling of total immersion that allows you to go full-on head-to-head with a game not found in somewhat lighter terms. Coming up on it's ninth birthday, LA-MULANA continues to captivate, frustrate and annihilate new and old players alike.

The game starts like any other morning at SherriSoda Tower as you take the elevator up to open Cook, Serve, Delicious!, a platinum star restaurant that was surging in popularity thanks to your amazing chef and management skills. Just then, a swarm of police surround SherriSoda Tower.

Features include: A 60+ hour experience as you build your restaurant from a roach infested eatery to a World Class Platinum Star experience by either running your own restaurant or branching out as a chef for hire, where you take jobs within the tower and various restaurants as you gain experience with the large array of foods, which spans 400 levels across 33 restaurants! Several modes including Classic Mode that brings back the classic gameplay of the original, Stress mode that instantly rockets the difficulty to the highest setting, and Zen mode, which allows you to take it easy and relaxes many of the stressful elements to provide an easy day of cooking.

You will deal with the day-to-day business as the shop owner while you unlock new things that will help you run a lucrative enterprise. As the shopkeeper of your very own shop you are in charge of buying, selling, and making a profit. Items can be bought from passing traders or delivered at a fee. Items can be placed on displays in order to sell them to customers. When you are ready, you can open your shop to start the day and let customers in. Customers will buy what you have on display if it matches what they are looking for. If you don't provide what a customer wants in time, they will be sad and leave. A day of shopkeeping can be stressful but rewarding! Bring out your interior designer by freely placing and rotating all furniture or use snapping if inaccuracy drives you nuts. Furniture comes in a variety of categories. There are displays which let you display items to sell in your shop. Decorations will make your shop more appealing and increase the amount of customers that come to your shop. You can increase the item stock capacity by placing storage type furniture. With crafting type furniture you can produce items to sell in your shop. When you have amassed enough money you can decide to expand your shop. The shop building is tile based where you decide what floor to place and what walls surround each tile. Walls can also be windows, archways, or doors. Expanding will also make your shop more appealing to customers as each piece makes your shop more appealing. Each wall type has a matching entrance to really tie the place together. Crafting lets you create items that you can sell in your shop. Crafting requires resources but lets you gain experience so that you can create higher quality items than what you can get from traders. Currently you can craft tools and weapons at the forge and clothing at the tailoring station. As the game develops, more crafting options will become available. In Winkeltje you can buy seeds from traders, plant seeds in planters, water plants, and harvest crops. Crops are items that you can sell in your shop. If crops aren't cared for they can wither and die. As time goes by you will encounter events and seasons. Events and seasons can affect the supply and demand for certain items. It can be profitable to stock up on certain items so that you can sell them for more profit when the time is right.",,"Minimum:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 7 (64 bit),Processor:,i5 6300U,Memory:,6 GB RAM,Graphics:,Intel HD 520,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,256 MB available space","Recommended:,Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system,OS:,Windows 10 (64 bit),Processor:,i5,Memory:,8 GB RAM,Graphics:,GeForce GTX 770,DirectX:,Version 11,Storage:,512 MB available space",9.99

Fueling this all new Call of Duty experience, the franchise's new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms. Single Player Campaign Ten years after a devastating mass event, America?€?s borders and the balance of global power have changed forever. As what's left of the nation's Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as ""Ghosts"" leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. A New Call of Duty Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty?? before. Multiplayer In Call of Duty: Ghosts you don't just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty?? game, the player can also choose their gender. With 20,000 possible combinations, this is the most flexible and comprehensive character customization in Call of Duty history. New dynamic maps are the evolution of multiplayer. They include interactive elements and player triggered events that make the environment evolve as each match goes on. The entire landscape can shift and force players to change tactics and strategies. Call of Duty: Ghosts introduces new tactical player movements. The new contextual lean system now allows players to lean around obstacles without adding button combinations or fully leaving cover. The new mantling system allows fluid movement over objects, while maintaining momentum. The knee slide allows for a natural transition from sprinting crouching to prone. Call of Duty: Ghosts delivers over 20 NEW Kill Streaks such as Juggernaut Maniac, the Helo Scout, the Vulture and the ODIN Strike.

This page contains spoilers to the first game, so if this is your first time hearing about Muv-Luv series, we recommend playing Muv-Luv first. About Muv-Luv Alternative: This is it. The chips are down, the die?€?s been cast, and the fate of the multiverse is on the line. Step back into the cockpit and prepare for deployment in Muv-Luv Alternative, the most critically acclaimed visual novel of all time. Just be sure to keep a box of tissues handy, because it?€?s about to be a bumpy ride. This isn?€?t a cutesy high school rom-com anymore; it?€?s an epic tale of political conspiracies, international espionage, an alien menace, quantum causality, bittersweet reunions, genetic modification, and much, much more. Gluttons for punishment, rejoice, because once it gets rolling, there are no brakes on this pain train. It?€?ll test your limits, challenge your worldview, and by the time it?€?s all over, you?€?ll be so emotionally spent that it?€?ll be weeks before you can fully process the implications of what you?€?ve just witnessed. Fair warning, though: common side effects include feelings of emptiness, PTSD, and unrealistic expectations for any and all other visual novels. This definitive release comes complete with a brand new translation, all-new CGs, additional voice acting, and dual language/ tablet support, so if you think you?€?re ready to take the dive, there?€?s never been a better time to strap in and see for yourself why so many readers consider this the greatest story ever told. The Story So Far (PLEASE NOTE: The following section contains major spoilers for the previous installment in the franchise. Muv-Luv Alternative picks up where the events of the original Muv-Luv left off, and certain scenes will play out differently depending on your choices in the first game. To get the most out of the Muv-Luv experience, we highly recommend that you complete the original game before starting Muv-Luv Alternative. Click here to jump to the game?€?s product page on Steam.) Three years have passed since the day Takeru, an unsuspecting Japanese high-schooler, suddenly awoke in a world not his own ?€? a war-torn alternate reality in which mankind was on the brink of extinction, locked in a decades-long struggle against the ruthless extra-terrestrial invaders known only as the BETA. In that time, he?€?s been through an awful lot ?€? enlisting in the military, meeting parallel-universe versions of his old friends, and even falling in love. But unbeknownst to Takeru, he and his squadmates were being trained to participate in a top-secret UN contingency plan known as Alternative IV ?€? a last-ditch effort to take back the Earth via experimental technology. Unfortunately, however, development screeched to a halt when the project?€?s chief executive, Professor Kouzuki, hit a wall in her research due to technological constraints. With tensions rising, and pressure to shift gears from governments all across the world, the UN delegation opted to scrap the project in favor of its successor: Alternative V. This was humanity?€?s last resort ?€? a plan that utilized all of their remaining resources to build a migrant fleet of interstellar craft, allowing a tiny fraction of the population to abandon the Earth in the hopes of finding life anew in another star system. Takeru and his comrades-in-arms were among those left behind, condemned to death by their fellow man. But it seems the hand of fate has bigger plans for Takeru, because it?€?s at this point that he wakes up to find himself back in his childhood bedroom once again. Not in his own world, mind you ?€? but back where he was first spat out into this hellscape three years prior. This was no dream; this was a recurring nightmare. But then it hits him: this is a second chance. If he?€?s truly been sent back in time, then he?€?s the only one who knows of the impending doom that awaits this world. Perhaps he can use this knowledge to warn Professor Kouzuki, and together, they can somehow find a way to prevent Alternative V from ever being enacted. And who knows? If he can change history, then maybe ?€? just maybe ?€? he?€?ll find the answers to all of his questions. Why has he gone back in time? Why isn?€?t Sumika here? And most importantly, what IS Alternative IV? Features: Linear Visual Novel - Unlike the first two parts, Muv-Luv Alternative is almost designed  as a straightforward interactive premiere movie, complete with voice acting, subtitles, and intense music, perfectly fitting for a finale. Over 50-70 hours reading time. Available in three languages - Japanese, English and Simplified Chinese. The UI has been reworked, so it's compatible with the newest tablet PCs and touchscreens. User save data are stored in Steam cloud so readers can continue their progress anywhere with ease.

The golden age of turn-based tactics returns with a distinct Japanese flavor. A story filled with political intrigue and personal conflict follows the assassination of the Artemesian king. Command your infantry, roll out the tanks, and take to the skies to exact swift retribution against your foes. Artemesia is awaiting your orders! Inspired by turn-based strategy games of the past, TINY METAL takes the finely honed gameplay of classical Japanese war gaming and brings it into the modern era with great graphics, 15 unique units, and never-before-seen gameplay mechanics. TINY METAL is the Japanese arcade war game you wish you had as a kid. Play as Artemisian Lieutenant Nathan Gries as he commands his units to victory against the villainous nation of Zipang. There will be several friends and enemies along the way with varied factions, units, and abilities in the 20 hours of single-player campaign gameplay. Players will have to carefully consider varying terrain, positioning for attacks, and strategic advancements and defenses. Nathan Gries Lieutenant Nathan Gries hails from a family of military lineage. His father died in the last war when Nathan was still young. Col. Lindberg was a friend of Nathan's father and came to offer guidance to Nathan. Nathan is well-regarded by his superiors and peers alike with a promising future and noble intentions... Although Nathan is a model officer, his lack of experience may lead to situations where he could be exploited. Wolfram Commander Wolfram, a fierce, strategic, independent, business-minded soldier, and leader of the White Fangs. She lost her brother in the previous Artemisia/Zipang war. He fought, foolishly, for a nation that cared little for him. Which is irrelevant. He died believing he was fighting for a greater cause. She vowed never to make the same mistake. Wolfram will take any job that is profitable but one never knows what she might have up her sleeve... Isoroku Tsukumo Lord Isoroku Tsukumo (""of 3 million stones""), the leading vassal of the Zipang shogunate. His title is a measure of his greatness, how much he owns, and how many people he supports with his rule. Tsukumo has an extreme obligation to duty and honor. He takes care of his people first and foremost but is always strict and lawful, especially to himself. Campaign mode  Follow the gripping story of Nathan and his unit as they struggle with the war and question what is -- and what isn't -- worth fighting for in a 20-hour campaign full of unique characters of various factions. Unique Attack System Use careful planning and strategy to attack from positions behind and beside to inflict more damage, or Focus Fire attacks with multiple units to crush your enemies! Online Multiplayer Soon-to-be-added online mode will test you against other players in 1-on-1 matches online or via local play! Skirmish Matches Jump straight into the action with dozens of skirmish matches that challenge the player with fun scenarios against a variety of foes. Units Take control of 15 unique units, from basic Riflemen to advanced Gunships and Metals, each with their own strengths and weakness.

So to accomplish your mission of world extermination, you will need to help guide them to their next yummy meal.  Luckily you can utilize numerous special mutations to make your troops evolve and fulfil their appetite for flesh. But beware! Humans will not facilitate your dark will?€?.they will fight to survive.

GAMEPLAY Ash of Gods is the story of three separate protagonists rising in response to a centuries-old menace once thought to be mere folklore. Captain Thorn Brenin, the bodyguard Lo Pheng, the scribe Hopper Rouley, and many others, do not yet know that the reapers have returned and intend to drown the world in blood so that they may awaken the sleeping gods. Ash of Gods?€? storyline is constantly evolving in response to players?€? choices, sometimes even resulting in death. But, the death of a character is not game over. Instead, the story moves forward with the death of that character and previous choices continuing to impact future events. Combat in Ash of Gods is a blend of both traditional turn-based strategy and CCG gameplay. While individual tactics will depend upon the skills and classes of your characters, you will unlock and accumulate cards that have the power to unleash powerful abilities, sometimes altering the course of an entire battle. WHAT MAKES ASH OF GODS UNIQUE  Decisions with Major Impacts Every decision, whether on or off the battlefield, has the capacity to alter the course of events and the fate of your party with major repercussions. But, even the death of your leader is not the end of your journey. No Random Dice Rolls There are no dice throws to determine chance-to-hit or the force of a blow. In Ash of Gods, true tacticians must master the skills of their classes and harness the powers granted by their limited supplies of cards, or suffer the consequences. AI that Adapts to You Ash of Gods?€? AI adapts to your style of play to ensure a consistently challenging experience with no room for cheap tactics or invincible team builds. PvP Multiplayer Challenge other players and compete for a spot on the leaderboards. Unlock new characters, upgrades, and cards to customize your tactics even further. Rewards for Risk Expend your own HP for a last-ditch attack. Go into battle with a smaller team to get better cards and quicker rounds. Take the shorter, but more dangerous route to save on resources.

DINOSAURS. This game is a sequel of the original classic dinosaur hunting video game, Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter. It?€?s an authentic hunting simulation where you track and stalk your prey. Careful and thoughtful consideration must be taken during the hunt; to survive you'll need to know your preys temperament and mannerisms, and just like in real hunting, you need to be aware of your surroundings (you don't want to be caught upwind of a T-Rex or you'll end being lunch). Remember you're not hunting deer, you're hunting dinosaurs. You?€?ll visit huge, beautifully rendered and realistic 3D environments, each with their own unique Eco systems. There are pristine beaches, dense jungles, pine forests, muddy marshes, rocky plains and deserts to explore. Environments can be used to increase the odds of a successful hunt. Players can follow trails and track animal footprints. Awareness of wind direction is important since some dinosaurs can smell you. Using stealth and land elevation will give you a sound advantage over some of the more vicious dinosaurs. Choose between a high caliber rifle, sniper rifle, a silent crossbow or tranquilizer gun, which puts your prey to sleep instead of killing it. You can also carry sidearms. Some of your equipment includes a handheld Gadget, which includes radar and GPS satellite positioning to make tracking the beasts easier, Cover Scent which masks your smell and numerous other goodies, which will prove indispensable for your hunting adventure. There is a wide variety of different dinosaurs to hunt each with unique behaviors and intelligence. Every dinosaur in Carnivores has realistic, advanced AI logic, so from species to species , each will react differently to you. Some dinosaurs will flee if they see you, while others will become enraged and attack. During your adventure you'll experience everything from ""pea-brained"" dummies to cunning dinosaurs, with heightened senses of sight, hearing and smell. So be careful and stalk your prey intelligently, otherwise you might be the one being hunted. key Features: Hunt the largest and most ferocious animals known to man ?€? the Dinosaurs!

You can?€?t rise to the top without taking a few others down. If that means engaging in a workplace accidents, dodgy deals, and a shifty trick or two then so be it! You're going to need every trick in the book if you want to go from small-time slumlord to property tycoon ! In Constructor , you take on the role of a budding property tycoon who must do battle with your competitors to create a thriving and profitable city... in ANY way you see fit! Build houses and factories, cope with the incessant demands of your tenants as well as keeping a whole bunch of UNDESIRABLE characters under control! This ?€?colourful?€? group of degenerates can also be used against the competition with humorous and catastrophic effect! After all, it's time you stopped playing by the rules and did things your way, and who knows you might even get away it, too! Have you ever looked at your rival's town and thought ""That's quite a nice property you've got there. Mind if I take it?"" Well, stop looking and send your trusty Foreman over to rip up the fence panels! Soon enough, you'll find yourself the proud owner of a previously used property - no deposit necessary! Sell it out from under your rival's nose for a quick profit or place your own tenant inside it for long-term gain. Of course, if you're not so interested in what the property can do for you but more about what it can do to your rival then simply let it fall into disrepair. Soon enough it'll become infested and eventually explode... hopefully taking out a few of your rival's men or properties with it! CRIME IS YOUR GREATEST TOOL. If all else fails, call in the Mob?€? Send your Gangsters around to take out your rival's most important properties, or hit their people to thin their ranks before you move in for the finishing blow. The more they kill the better the weapons your Gangsters will be able to access including but not limited to pistols and the devastating laser! A force to be reckoned with if ever there was one. Of course, if you've got cold feet and dealing with the Mob isn't your cup of tea you can also hire the services of various undesirables to do your bidding. Show your rival's just how much you really care by sending Mr Fixit over to provide 'assistance' with one of your rival's properties. If you'd prefer to just watch the carnage unfold send the happy-go-lucky chainsaw wielding Psycho over to carve up your rival's investments, and maybe just about anyone who tries to stop him! Just watch that whilst all this is happening that you don't forget about the latest nagging from the Council or it might just be closing time... for good! Just when you thought you'd earned yourself a tea break... Boom! The Council are on your back about some issue or another, and if you don't keep them happy you'll either lose some of your hard-earned investment properties or risk being closed down . Permanently. Keep them happy, though, and you'll be rewarded with special marks that can be sold for a quick cash injection, or as a way of staying in good with the Council as you proceed to ignore every one of your tenant's incessant demands. Treat your tenants well, though. In Constructor they're not only your most important form of income, you're going to need them if you want to breed additional children to one day join your workforce. This is especially true if you want to stay ahead because you'll need all of the help you can get to ensure that your factories continue churning out resources, gadgets, and of course industrial pollution. If you think you've got what it takes to be successful in the world of Constructor then put on your hard-hat and start digging. You've got tenants to please, rent to collect, and rivals to keep guessing. After all it's your town... so deal with it! TAKE A GANDER AT THESE FEATURES. An interactive tutorial guides you through the very basic concepts of Constructor from building your first properties to taking over your first properties. Six free play scenarios that test your ability from Financial Conquest all the way up to the perfect Utopian State. Keep things interesting by adding an opponent or three into the fray. Assist Nigel Plasterboard of Cobble & Stones across six multi-staged story missions. Why did Nigel abandon you during the tutorial? Who is Vincenzo? Are you even reading this? We'll never really know. Five different locations including lush countryside towns, an abandoned industrial sector, and a lush tropical jungle. The ever-present Council will keep you hard-pressed as it periodically harasses kindly asks you to complete various tasks based not only on your own progress, but that of your rival's as well. If your rival suddenly has an increase in active Hippy Communes then you can bet your most expensive property that you'll be hearing about it. Law enforcement helps you protect your investments from your rivals. If you're feeling a little more unlawful then consult with the Mob and create Gangsters of your own to deal with the problems directly. Populate your town with ten different tenants each with their own ridiculous demands and quirky personalities. From slovenly Slobs up to the snobby Sloanes you'll have no shortage of unfortunate residents to charge exorbitant rental fees! Getting tired of that one Major always complaining about a tree you planed in his garden? Kick him out and move in someone else who has a finer appreciation of garden apparel. Whatever that means. Six different Super Tenants each with their own function to help your town run just that little bit better. Keep them happy, though, because they tend to demand just a little extra attention than your average tenant. Seven wacky and completely undesirable... undesirables . Rob them blind with the Thief or blow them up with Mr Fixit. No job is too dirty for this lot. Well, unless it happens to be Mr Fixit bodging the plumbing, and spreading raw sewage all over someone's garden. Use your tenants to breed new members of your workforce. Look after your people by sending them to the hospital to keep them in peak physical condition. Decorate your town, and keep your tenants happy, with multiple garden decorations.

Build trenches, call in artillery, upgrade your squad, and lead them to victory. Skirmish Line is a Mud-and-Blood-like game, taking core fundamentals such as as a bird's eye view camera, semi-autonomous units, and heavy randomization. Skirmish Line aims to deliver an updated playing experience, featuring new mechanics and content. Both fans of Mud and Blood and new players alike will find the game challenging as they face off against the fanatical Imperial Japanese army, featuring a host of exotic weapons, vehicles, and of course, the infamous Banzai charges. Skirmish Line is a brutal and difficult endless defense game featuring three modes: Defense in Depth Defend three positions in succession against the relentless Imperial Japanese Army. If the enemy overruns, you will retreat to the next position. Should you find the enemy assaults too overwhelming, you may manually fallback to the next position. Do you retreat in order to preserve the lives of your men, or do you put up a determined defense in order to hold valuable ground? Point Defense For a more traditional experience, Point Defense is stylized after Mud and Blood 2. Advance forward to find favorable terrain or to gain valuable command points to spend on new soldiers, weapons, and defenses. But be careful, there is no retreat, no fallback positions in this mode! Campaign Mode Build and manage your own squad in a persistent campaign, spanning multiple missions. You will be pressured by the overzealous theater commander to succeed on your missions at all costs, pitting the lives of your men versus the mission's objective. As you progress, you will be sent on more dangerous missions. Use your renown as a field commander to purchase powerful upgrades in order to keep your squad alive and to complete the mission. Ribbons, Medals, and Rank Complete extraordinary feats to earn ribbons and medals. Each ribbon or medal offers benefits to your squad. Gain access to special weapons, soldiers, and new tactics as you rank up. Official Wiki We understand that Skirmish Line can be a very difficult game. We have an official wiki for players to share their knowledge. Official Disclaimer Skirmish Line takes direct inspiration from Mud and Blood 2 but is not an official Mud and Blood game nor is it affiliated with that of its primary creator, Urbzz.

The game centers on an old, worn down restaurant in the SherriSoda Tower, which was once the heart of the building but closed down as business (and tenants) dropped to an all time low. But with the local economy rising back up and occupancy reaching its maximum, SherriSoda Tower has decided to bring back the old Cook, Serve, Delicious restaurant, and has given you complete control to bring it back to its old five star status of world class dining. To do that, you?€?ll start with a few thousand dollars and thirty foods to choose from to put on your menu, as well as a host of restaurant equipment and more. Nearly everything is unlocked from the start of the game for you to purchase; this is your restaurant, and you must figure out the best strategy to get that restaurant packed with satisfied customers. Can you prove your culinary skills? And if that weren?€?t enough, you?€?ll also have the opportunity to be cast in the Iron Cook television show, throw parties for offices in SherriSoda Tower, read virtual mail in your SherriSoda Tower Email account which ranges from game tips to crazy spam (nearly 500 emails in all), from customers providing feedback to your restaurant to opportunities such as being able to fund projects via ?€?ClicknStart?€? and other big surprises! With hours of content and tons of secrets and unlockables, Cook, Serve, Delicious will provide a big challenge for anyone who?€?s ready to take their crumbling, rat infested eatery to a luxurious Platinum Star Restaurant. Good luck!

Your goal is to survive as long as possible and endure as many enemy waves as you can. How to Play YORG.io The game is divided into day and night. During the day you will be safe, so use this time wisely to prepare and fortify your base. Start by building your base and placing crystal mines which are your main source of income. If your mines are not connected to your base, place a transporter. To defend your base and survive the night, you will need defensive towers; since those require ammunition, you will have to build factories to produce them; these factories require resources, you will have to build mines to extract them. Did we mention the importance of supply lines? At night, zombies will spawn and attack your buildings. Every day the zombies steadily get stronger, and every 10 waves a zombie boss will spawn. The game is lost when your Base is destroyed. Highly Replayable Each game starts with a new configuration of available resources. This configuration must be carefully considered when placing your base and will change your strategy from game to game. Unique towers Each tower has strengths and weaknesses. Place them carefully to make sure you are using them to their full potential and always make sure they have plenty of ammo. Enemy Abilities As the day turn into night the waves of Zombies become harder. Zombies will evolve various abilities that will challenge even the most titanic defenses. Big Boss The Dread Overlord shows up every 10 waves. This boss will require all your might to defeat it. Do not underestimate it!

Story mode is the main meat and bones of the game, it is the action-adventure-rpg-somewhat-4X segment, offering npcs, missions, colony building, farming, training, diplomacy, and of course, a storyline that you can follow or ignore. This story features a 17X8km world map with many unique character, landscapes, biomes, locations, and over 140 types of potential enemies.

That can still eventually arrive at the ending. And yes, there is an ending. Story mode also features coop with other players. Adventure Mode ?€?

Slip the surly bonds of earth and take to the skies as a bold Captain, fearless Gunner, or cunning Engineer. Raising the stakes on team-based PvP combat with an emphasis on strategic competition and team play, Guns of Icarus Online is all about teamwork, tactics, and fast-paced action. With a good ship and the right crew, you can conquer the skies! A vivid steampunk world  Lumbering, heavily-armored airships bristling with guns patrol the skies above a land ravaged beyond repair by an out-of-control industrial revolution. Build your own airship  Starting from a selection of basic hulls, players can mix and match hundreds of custom parts to create their own unique airship, then assemble a crew to fly it. Your ship is your life  Your ship is your collective life bar - when the ship goes down, the crew goes down with it. Every member of the crew plays an integral role in not only maintaining the integrity - ?€?life?€? - of the ship, but also weakening the integrity of enemy ships as they work cooperatively towards a shared victory. The ultimate multiplayer team experience  You won?€?t be told to stay still and not die while a veteran preserves their Kill/Death ratio. In Guns of Icarus Online, you have to work together. It?€?s an entirely interdependent gameplay experience that cannot be won by a single crew member. Goggles, gears, and glory  A wide range of costumes and cosmetic options to show off your style are available in the in-game store. These items are cosmetic only - there is no pay-to-win in Guns of Icarus Online. Pit crew against crew Form a party with up to 4 friends and crew a ship together to battle against other teams in massive airship battles with up to 32 players in a match with multiple game modes including Deathmatch, King of the Hill, Crazy King, Skyball, and VIP. Rise in the ranks  Earn titles and cosmetic upgrades through your achievements. Balanced, competitive matches reward strategic, skillful play, not level grinding. The Industrial Revolution never ended. Raging out of control, the new machines consumed the world, staining the sky, scouring the land and poisoning the water. Humanity came the brink of extinction, all but destroyed by their own unrestrained ingenuity. A few pockets of civilization survived, sheltering in the crevices of the world, and it is time for a comeback. Divided by wide expanses of toxic wasteland, a handful of these remnants have developed airship technology. Cruising through the sky, safely away from the poisoned earth, trade and industry could finally begin anew. However, with resources so desperately limited, war was inevitable. We are Muse Games, an independent studio based out of New York City. Our debut game, Flight of the Icarus , was the seed that would later grow into our flagship title. After releasing the unique and eye-catching platform game CreaVures in 2011, we dedicated ourselves to re-engineering our debut title into a fully-featured cooperative online airship combat game. We released Guns of Icarus Online in October 2012, right in the midst of Hurricane Sandy. Despite that challenging start, the game earned a loyal audience and built up a healthy community, passing the million player mark in January 2016. Since then, we have remained committed to supporting and expanding the Guns of Icarus experience.

You're a hacker with full freedom to act as you wish on a vast network of procedurally generated computers. File Explorer, Terminal and Text Editor are some of the programs that will be available from the start of the game. As you improve your skills you will find new utilities that you may install and use. The terminal has a fundamental role, based on real UNIX commands; it is an indispensable tool for carrying out successful hacking operations. Online mode: A living persistent world. Explore the Grey Hack universe and forge your own reputation in a world shared by all players. When you leave the game, the online universe remains actively running 24/7. This always active game session means that the changes you have made in any computer in the world can be seen by players who connect to them even if you are no longer online. Your progress will be saved, but your actions may have consequences. Grey Hack will never have a monthly subscription to enjoy the online experience. Roadmap Grey Hack is in the Alpha phase. Version 0.6 has now been completed and development of version 0.7 has begun. You can check the Roadmap in detail here . You will find updated information on the features that have been implemented, and which ones will be added in the coming updates. Here is a summary of some features that are not yet available in the current version but will be included in future updates: One of the main objectives of the development is that each player action influences the world and therefore the other players. For example, you will be able to act in your own self-interest; even if you cause collateral damage, help the authorities stop criminals or simply keep a low profile and take advantage of the actions of other players. Another planned feature is the possibility of joining a group of hackers to carry out coordinated attacks, or creating your own group in which you will be able to recruit other players. Can I be hacked as soon as I start a new game in online mode? No, to be hacked you need to have open ports in your machine, and for that you have to perform a series of steps. Some game elements require that you open ports on your machines, but it is not possible for someone to hack a new player who has just started. Single Player Mode Grey Hack is intended to be played in Online Mode, benefiting from the richer environment of an always-online universe, but the game also offers a single player mode for those so inclined. In Single Player mode, you play in a world created on your computer. Unlike Online Mode, when you exit the game in Single Player, the in-game universe stops, and progress resumes only upon your return. In Single Player mode, during the development, you may experience a worse performance than Online Mode. This is because in Single Player mode all the system load and background processes are performed on your computer, unlike the Online Mode where the same functions are performed by the official Grey Hack server. Feedback I am open for suggestions. If there is any feature you would like to see in the game, do not hesitate to let me know through the Steam forums or the official Discord channel .",,,,9.99

Our terrain is built from real-world earth data.  Airport designs are based on real-world layouts.  Game play has been designed by real-world air traffic controllers and commercial pilots.  Even the aircraft flight characteristics are highly realistic.  Watch as the airplanes actually raise their nose during the takeoff rotation, and during the landing flare.   Sounds are authentic.  We've added the rumble of an aircraft's takeoff thrust, and the whine of a jet engine as it spools up at the gate. Airport Madness 3D is a game you've got to play! We've worked hard to compare our air traffic control game to that of 3D simulations that are currently for sale elsewhere, and what we feel everybody wants is a game that's easy to grasp, lots of fun, and highly addictive.
